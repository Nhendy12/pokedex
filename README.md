## General Info 📝
For simplicity, both the backend and front end will be contained in the same GitHub. If this were a larger project I would most definitely separate the Front and Backend.\

## Final Thoughts/Room for Improvement 🔔
I really enjoyed working on this project and I loved the pokemon aspect that added that personal touch!\
It definitely helped me brush up on my React skills and I think in the future I will be adding more to this project!

Items I missed/would have done with more time:
* Better form validation
* Getting the forms to closer match the designs
* Fixing inheritances, right now when you create or update a pokemon it just refreshes the page. I would have liked it to instead just rerender the list of pokemon
* Add tests
* Loading States
* Empty States
* demo
* API docs
* File structure/css organization
